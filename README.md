# Cisco-Packet-Tracer-AppImage
AppImage for Packet Tracer 7.3.0 (Cisco somehow still can't properly push a working linux app)

I had to build an appimage for this to work, i struggled a few days to install it on ubuntu. Tried the .deb package, the official .run installer, a snap, windows .exe on Wine. NOTHING worked so i built this with pkg2appimage. Finally, it works how it should have in the first place.
Feel free to spread it.
